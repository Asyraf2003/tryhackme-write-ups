## 🎯 Room Objectives

This room is designed to introduce you to the fundamental concepts and workflow of offensive security through hands-on experience:

- Develop a hacker mindset: *“To beat a hacker, you need to think like one.”*
- Perform a basic exploitation against a simulated application (FakeBank) in a safe environment.
- Demonstrate real-world impact (e.g., transferring fake money).

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

- **Offensive Security**: A proactive approach to breaking systems, discovering vulnerabilities, and fixing them before they can be exploited.
- **Penetration Testing (Pentesting)**: Simulated hacking to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Wordlist attack**: Using a wordlist to discover hidden elements (e.g., `/bank-deposit`).
- **FakeBank**: A practical target used to simulate a fake banking environment.
